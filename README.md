# Chat-App-Project
Project for school  

Chatters establish a connection with the server and can do the following :


    Create a profile (login, password) and save it
    login

    List topics
    create topics
    join topics (only one - bonus : many at the same time)

    send messages to all chatters on a specific topic
    send private messages 
    ...
   
This project is separated in 2 versions : the console app and the WPF app.  
Each version has the server executable and the client executable.  
No release versions are planned.
